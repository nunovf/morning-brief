          "pitch": "A framework for DMO digital transformation that takes the long view: AI adoption that isn't grounded in clear strategy and organisational readiness tends to produce noise rather than signal. The 'grounding' metaphor is well-chosen — this is about anchoring AI capability to actual destination goals rather than chasing the technology itself."

Safe-to-fail environments, intrinsic motivation, and regular practice at open-ended problems emerge as the recurring variables. Concrete and immediately usable for anyone planning learning experiences."

Brief, concentrated, and worth sitting with slowly."

          "pitch": "A 2025 paper in Frontiers in Psychology maps what happens psychologically when Buddhist meditation practice goes beyond conventional mindfulness — examining equanimity, non-conceptual awareness, and the distinctive pathways different traditions activate. More readable than most academic work; the distinctions it draws are genuinely useful for serious practitioners."

His answer involves evolutionary timescales, the age of language versus the age of thought, and why Kekul\u00e9 dreamed of a snake instead of just knowing the molecule was a ring. A short, strange, and remarkable piece."

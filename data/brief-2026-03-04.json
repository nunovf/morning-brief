          "pitch": "Codrops explores what making a truly interactive, animated website looks like in 2026 — not the flashy kind, but the purposefully designed kind. The article bridges technical implementation with design intent, and makes the case that interactivity is increasingly a baseline expectation, not a differentiator."

Structured data, authoritative content, and conversational formats all feature as practical strategies."

          "pitch": "A practitioner-educator argues that the shift from teaching syntax to teaching strategy is not optional — it is what the AI era demands. The essay reframes what good coding education actually looks like when the hard part isn't writing the code anymore, with specific implications for curriculum design that any coding teacher can act on."

          "pitch": "Consciousness researchers have made progress partly by studying what's left when it goes — patients in minimally conscious states, people under anaesthesia, infants. This essay explores the productive paradox that studying the absence of something is sometimes the most reliable way to understand what the thing actually is."

          "pitch": "The injunction to 'be present' turns out to rest on a stack of metaphysical claims that most practitioners never examine. This essay distinguishes between different types of present-moment practice — some grounded, some not — and asks what we are actually committing to when we follow a teacher's instruction to attend to now."

          "pitch": "A quiet revolution in biology is challenging the idea that organisms are shaped purely by external selection pressures. New research suggests organisms have something like internal goals — and that purpose, long expelled from science, might need to be quietly invited back. A piece at the edge of where biology and philosophy of mind converge."

  "through_line": "Running through today's brief is a question about relational identity — who we are in relation to those we raise, those we learn from, and those whose thinking we inherit. From children navigating AI to the neuroscience of rewiring the self, to a Japanese ethics of collective being, the thread is the same: identity is never fully individual.",

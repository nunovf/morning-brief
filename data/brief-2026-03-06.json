          "pitch": "Sojern's annual snapshot of how U.S. destination marketers are approaching their work leads with a finding that feels counterintuitive: the 'always-on' mindset is less about quantity and more about intelligence — knowing when to be present, in which channels, for which moments. Practical and directional."

          "pitch": "A design studio's survey of where web animation is heading in 2025, with specific attention to the shift from decorative motion to motion that communicates. The examples are specific and the design rationale is clear — a useful counterpoint to the more technical focus of the Smashing series earlier this week."

          "pitch": "A national research study finds that while nearly all educators believe engagement is critical to learning, most are uncertain what it actually looks like in practice — and systematically overlook quieter, inward forms of engagement in favour of visible, measurable ones. The implications for how learning experiences get designed are significant and immediately applicable."

          "pitch": "A personal essay by someone who went from French anarchist to ordained Zen teacher — and the account is neither evangelical nor sentimental. What comes through is the discipline of it: the patient accumulation of practice, the non-dramatic way it reshapes how you see and respond. A Friday read."

Written by the researcher who named them, this essay is as much philosophical as scientific."

The emphasis on responsible workflows and creative accountability makes this more thoughtful than most AI-tools coverage."

Useful for anyone thinking about how to adapt and improve a teaching practice."

The robot thought experiment is more rigorous than it sounds, and the essay ends somewhere genuinely surprising."

The paper examines what 'awareness knowing itself' actually means, drawing on Zen, Mah\u0101mudr\u0101, and Dzogchen alongside cognitive science."

The implications for how we think about adaptation, agency, and directionality in nature are significant."
